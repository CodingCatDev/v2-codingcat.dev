Amplify Admin UI


What’s the Amplify Admin UI? Is this something new?

Do you need an AWS account to get started?

What’s so special about the new visual data modeler?

GSI’s are always difficult, does this help? (In relation to the data modeler)

What are some other major features you can have with the Admin UI? (we can talk about auth)

Access outside the AWS Management Console

This is amazing but could we talk a little bit about how it works? Is it running on Java somehow, like Firebase emulator?

Non-technical users – how do they use it?

How does this new Amplify Admin UI work with existing customers?

How do they turn it on?
CLI users
