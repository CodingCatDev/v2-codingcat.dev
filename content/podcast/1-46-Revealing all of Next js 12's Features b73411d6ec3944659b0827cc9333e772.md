3. Will I notice much speed difference with the Rust Compiler on a smaller site (100 pages)?
4. Lets talk a lot about Serverless functions vs. Edge Functions running on V8. It seems like this might have some pretty specific use cases.

5. To keep memory low you will probably want to do a lot of streaming of data correct
