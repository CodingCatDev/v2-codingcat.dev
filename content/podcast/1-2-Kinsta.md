General Questions
What is the difference between shared hosting, VPS, or dedicated hosting?

Why did Kinsta decide to use the shared container approach? <u>https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-hosting/#4-improved-performance?kaid=XIIHFPADWOKE</u>

Is this mainly for security, or speed or reliability?

Is pricing the biggest deciding factor for moving to GCP?
Is this savings passed to the customer? Let’s say that GCP gets even cheaper will my bill go down?
Performance
With CodingCatDev we have LearnDash LMS as well as Buddy Boss, both of these use heavy transactional data, would it be possible to use something faster for the database?

What is MariaDB <u>https://mariadb.org/</u>?

Why Kinsta?
What is the real <u>difference</u> between Kinsta and someone else?
